Detailed Roadmap and Milestones
Introduction

This document outlines the phased development approach for DreamWeaver. Our strategy prioritizes building the foundational AI core and its unique integration with the Polygon blockchain within the initial 6-month phase (Phase 2). This core system serves as the validated foundation upon which the full gameplay vision and ecosystem will be built in subsequent phases.
Phase Overview

    Phase 1: Genesis & Strategy (Completed): Defined the core vision, established the key pillars (Emergent AI, Gameplay Integration, Polygon Anchoring, Evolving Identity), designed the hybrid architecture, developed initial smart contracts, and formulated the strategic development plan.

    Phase 2: Foundational Prototype Development (Months 1-6 - Current Focus): Build and demonstrate the core AI processing loop, integrate verifiable AI milestone/journal anchoring on Polygon (Amoy Testnet), develop foundational DreamSoul representation, and create a basic demonstration interface. Goal: Validate Core Loop & On-Chain AI Verification.

    Phase 3: Gameplay & AI Expansion (Post-Phase 2): Implement core gameplay mechanics (Wisp system, combat, node exploration, rune system), integrate gameplay feedback into the AI loop, develop the full DreamSoul evolution system, scale AI infrastructure, and prepare for mainnet launch.

    Phase 4: Ecosystem Growth & Research (Long-Term): Expand gameplay features (advanced nodes, realms, social features), refine AI capabilities (self-reflection, goal adaptation), implement decentralized governance, foster community development, and publish research findings based on the AI's verifiable evolution.

Phase 2: Foundational Prototype Development (Months 1-6)

Phase Goal: Deliver a functional prototype demonstrating the core DreamWeaver AI loop processing user dreams, evolving based on internal metrics (simulated), executing basic AI-driven actions within the knowledge graph, and verifiably anchoring its evolutionary milestones and journal entries on the Polygon Amoy Testnet.

Key Deliverables (End of Month 6):

    D1: Deployed & Verified Core Contracts: DreamWeaverGraph.sol, DreamWeaverJournal.sol, and a basic DreamNFT.sol (representing DreamSoul) on Polygon Amoy.

    D2: Functional AI Backend Service: Running Python DreamWeaverEntity application integrating Neo4j, MongoDB Atlas Vector Search, and basic GNN/DRL inference capabilities, processing dreams via API.

    D3: Working AI-Polygon Integration: Demonstrated anchoring of AI state hashes via DreamWeaverGraph.updateGraphState and AI journal entries via DreamWeaverJournal.addEntry on Amoy, orchestrated by the backend Web3Interface.

    D4: Basic Demonstration Frontend: Web interface for dream submission (text + emotion) and viewing basic AI status (/nexus/status endpoint) with links to anchored PolygonScan transactions.

    D5: Technical Documentation: Comprehensive MkDocs site detailing the Phase 2 architecture, AI loop, contract interactions, and API.

    D6: Demonstration Video & Presentation: Recorded demo showcasing the core loop: Dream Submission -> AI Processing -> KG Update -> Milestone/Journal Anchoring on PolygonScan.

    D7: Phase 2 Completion Report: Detailed report outlining work completed, challenges faced, resource utilization, metrics achieved, and the refined roadmap for Phase 3.

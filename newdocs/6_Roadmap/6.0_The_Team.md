# The Team

## Current Status

DreamWeaver is led by Wes Lagarde, a self-taught developer who has brought the project from concept to prototype. Despite no formal computer science training, Wes has implemented:

- Modular backend architecture
- Blockchain integrations
- Complex data schemas
- AI integration systems
- Immersive narrative design

## Founder Profile

**Wes Lagarde - Founder/Lead Developer**

Starting his coding journey just three and a half years ago, Wes has quickly developed expertise across multiple domains through self-directed learning and practical implementation. He has successfully architected DreamWeaver's foundation, merging AI, blockchain, and immersive technology concepts into a coherent system.

## Growth Strategy

The evolution of DreamWeaver requires strategic team expansion:

1. **Technical Priorities**: Recruiting 1-2 developers with expertise in:
   - Blockchain and Web3 infrastructure
   - Scalable architecture 
   - AI system integration
   - Game development systems

2. **Ecosystem Integration**: Seeking partnerships and mentorship within the Polygon ecosystem to ensure best practices and optimal platform integration.

This combination of established solo progress and strategic team growth positions DreamWeaver for efficient scaling and development, balancing the project's innovative vision with the technical resources needed for successful implementation.

Who We're Looking For:
We're in search of a visionary technologist who thrives at the intersection of blockchain, AI, and augmented reality. This is more than a technical role; it's an opportunity to help shape the next evolution of digital consciousness by building the infrastructure behind DreamWeaver's living, interactive ecosystem.

Key Responsibilities:

    Smart Contract & On-Chain Integration:

        Develop and optimize smart contracts on Polygon (preferably with experience in Solidity and EVM-based development).

        Integrate on-chain verification processes, enabling seamless anchoring of DreamWeaver's AI milestones.

    Backend & AI Integration:

        Architect and implement a robust backend that fuses AI processing with blockchain data, utilizing frameworks like Python for AI/ML development and NetworkX for dynamic knowledge graphs.

        Enhance and evolve our AI workflows, ensuring that user-submitted dreams effectively feed into our emergent AI narrative.

    Immersive Frontend & Visualization:

        Build interactive, immersive user interfaces using Three.js to visualize our knowledge graph and the "phantom" overlay.

        Collaborate on creating narrative-driven user experiences that intertwine technical depth with artistic storytelling.

    Technical Storytelling & Documentation:

        Translate complex technical details into compelling, accessible narratives that captivate both tech-savvy audiences and broader stakeholders.

        Contribute to an evolving set of documentation and community guides that highlight our technological innovation.

Essential Qualifications & Experience:

    Blockchain Expertise: Proven experience with smart contract development, particularly on Polygon or similar EVM-compatible chains.

    Frontend Development: Solid background in JavaScript frameworks (e.g., React.js) with demonstrable expertise in Three.js or related 3D graphics libraries.

    AI & Data Handling: Experience with Python in an AI/ML context, including familiarity with NLP transformers, generative models, or other AI frameworks. Experience with managing graph-based data using tools like Neo4j or NetworkX is a strong plus.

    Integration & API Skills: Comfortable interfacing various systems, from blockchain networks and smart contracts to dynamic data visualizations.

    Community Engagement: An innate ability to contribute to open-source projects, mentor junior developers, and participate actively in technical communities.

Personal Attributes:

    Visionary & Innovative: A forward-thinking problem-solver with a passion for pioneering new tech paradigms.

    Collaborative & Communicative: Excellent at conveying complex ideas in clear, engaging language, making you both a technical expert and an effective storyteller.

    Driven & Adaptive: Eager to work in a fast-paced startup environment where your contributions directly shape the future of DreamWeaver.

    Creative Problem Solver: Enthusiastic about blending technical skill with artistic flair to create transformative digital experiences.

DreamWeaver Whitepaper
Abstract
DreamWeaver is an immersive, blockchain-enabled game that blends narrative depth with strategic gameplay. At its core, players interact with a mystical DreamVerse by accessing their subconscious through dream submissions, which are interpreted by a Dream Oracle to generate unique Dream Runes. These runes, along with collectible Dream Wisps and a pivotal Lucid Core (an ERC-721 token), create a layered ecosystem of combat, exploration, and lore. The system is designed to be both simple to learn and addictive to master, with multiple progression layers, utility-driven runes, and enhanced real-world interaction via augmented reality (AR).



Introduction
Currently in development  is a next-generation ar entertainment and gaming experience that marries the mystique of dream interpretation with blockchain technology and immersive gameplay. By leveraging a narrative where players’ subconscious dreams manifest as tangible in-game power, the system empowers users to shape their gaming experience based on personal creativity and strategic choices. With key blockchain elements ensuring asset ownership and tradability, DreamWeaver creates an ecosystem where every element—from the player's Lucid Core to every rune and wisp—is both a game mechanic and a collectible digital asset.

Core Components
Lucid Core
Role:
The Lucid Core is the player's spirit guide and gateway to the DreamVerse. It functions as an ERC-721 token and serves as a “housing unit” for Dream Wisps, similar to a Pokéball in traditional monster-catching games.

Mechanics:

Binding Wisps: Up to 3 Dream Wisps can be bound to a single Lucid Core.
Leveling: The Core levels up using purchasable and time-gated Lucid Core Fragments. A 21-day cooldown (blockchain enforced) ensures measured progression.
Unlocking Features: Higher Core levels allow the player to control more powerful wisps and access advanced features (e.g., additional rune slots).
Dream Wisps
Role:
Dream Wisps are the in-game avatars or companions that aid players in exploration, combat, and lore discovery. They are acquired in the wild or via NFT marketplaces and come with inherent affinities (e.g., Chaos, Fire, Nature).

Progression:

Battle Level: Gained through combat and skill progression (via an integrated skill tree). Wisps that are too high-level relative to the player’s knowledge or Core level become unruly.
Rune Slots: Each wisp can equip up to 3 Dream Runes, which empower them both in battle and in exploration.
Behavior:
Wisps that are unbound or have low bonding/overleveled stats may act unpredictably. Their misbehavior in combat can result in self-damage, unintended consumption of runes or items, or even hindering progression on the DreamWeaver Graph.

Dream Runes
Role:
Dream Runes are tangible manifestations of the player's subconscious dreams. Interpreted by the Dream Oracle, these runes are essential for enhancing a wisp's abilities, unlocking secret nodes, and accessing hidden lore.

Utility:

Battle: Provide combat buffs such as increased damage, regeneration, or critical hit bonuses.
Navigation/Keys: Unlock pathways and nodes in the DreamWeaver Graph.
Lore: Reveal fragments of the overarching story and enrich the game world.
Energy-Based Mechanics: Runes have energy charges, limiting their usage until they are recharged—this ties into both game strategy and in-game token economics.
Gameplay Mechanics
Dream Submission and Oracle Interpretation
Process:

Dream Submission: Players submit descriptions of their dreams via an in-game interface.
Oracle Interpretation: The Dream Oracle analyzes the text to identify key symbols (e.g., "Raven", "Ocean", "Clock") and returns interpretations along with associated affinities and meanings.
Rune Conversion: Players select one of the interpreted symbols to convert into a Dream Rune.
Limitations:
Players have a limited daily quota of dream submissions (e.g., 3 per day). This limit can be recharged either over time or via in-game tokens, ensuring balanced rune generation.

Combat System
Core Mechanic:
A simplified, rock–paper–scissors (RPS) style system augmented by elemental affinities.

Move Set:

Attack: Direct damage move, with advantages over Defend but vulnerable to Evade.
Defend: Reduces incoming damage, counters Evade.
Evade: Avoids damage from Attack but is less effective against Defend.
Channel: A risk/reward move that boosts the next action at the cost of increased vulnerability.
Elemental Affinities:
Each wisp and enemy carries an elemental type (e.g., Fire, Water, Chaos) that further modifies damage outcomes in a manner similar to Pokémon type interactions. For example:

Super Effective: +50% damage.
Not Very Effective: -50% damage.
Neutral: Standard damage.
Combat Consequences:

Unruly Wisps: If a wisp’s bonding is low or its battle level exceeds the player's control threshold, it may act unpredictably. Possible consequences include:
Self-Damage: Inflicting damage on itself.
Rune Drain: Randomly consuming a rune charge without beneficial effect.
Item Consumption: Accidentally using an inventory item (e.g., Dream Tokens).
Blocking Progress: Temporarily obstructing navigation paths.
Rune Energy and Durability
Energy Charges:
Every Dream Rune is endowed with a set number of energy charges (e.g., 5 charges maximum). Each use—whether in battle, unlocking a node, or triggering lore—is deducted from these charges.
Wisp Energy Pool:
Each wisp has its own energy pool (e.g., 10 energy points). Using a rune deducts from both the rune’s charge and the wisp’s energy. A depleted energy pool prevents further rune usage until recharged.
Recharge Mechanics:
Time-Based Recharge: Runes regain a portion of their energy (e.g., 1 charge per 24 hours) and wisps restore energy gradually (e.g., 2 energy per day).
Token-Based Recharge: Players can use in-game utility tokens (Dream Tokens) to instantly recharge runes or wisp energy pools.
Wisp Behavior and Binding
Binding to the Lucid Core:
Wisps are tethered to the player’s Lucid Core, which serves as their “home base.” Only up to 3 wisps may be bound at any given time.

Affinity and Obedience:

Bonding Level: Determines how cooperative the wisp is in combat and exploration. Increasing bonding can be achieved through combat victories, rune equipping, and even AR interactions.
Battle Level: Wisps level up through combat. However, using a wisp that exceeds the player’s current knowledge or Lucid Core level can trigger unruly behavior, causing detrimental in-game effects.
Player Progression
Knowledge Level:
Players gain knowledge by collecting lore fragments throughout the DreamVerse. This level affects which wisps and runes the player can effectively control.

Lucid Core Level:
Upgraded via purchasable Lucid Core Fragments (subject to a 21-day cooldown), the Core level defines the ceiling for wisp power and the number of bindable wisps.

Synergy and Skill Trees:
Wisps have an integrated skill tree that unlocks additional abilities and buffs as bonding increases. Skill unlocks are contingent upon meeting both bonding thresholds and prerequisite conditions.

Blockchain Integration and NFT Trading
Lucid Core as ERC-721 Token
Token Characteristics:
The Lucid Core is implemented as an ERC-721 non-fungible token (NFT), ensuring unique ownership and verifiable on-chain metadata.
Binding of Dream Wisps to the Lucid Core is recorded on-chain, maintaining a transparent record of player assets.
Dream Wisps as Tradable NFTs
NFT Mechanics:
Dream Wisps are also issued as ERC-721 tokens, allowing players to trade, sell, or purchase them on NFT marketplaces.
Each trade includes a built-in 5% creator royalty, ensuring ongoing revenue for original developers.
Upon transfer, certain parameters (such as affinity and battle level) reset to maintain game balance in new ownership.
Augmented Reality (AR) Interactions
AR Wisps
Real-World Integration:
Players can view their Dream Wisps in their real-world environment through AR-enabled mobile devices.
Using web-based AR frameworks (such as AR.js), players can scan QR codes or images to see 3D representations of their wisps.
AR Feeding and Interaction
Feeding Mechanic:
Beyond viewing, players can “feed” their AR wisps using Dream Tokens or specialized in-game items (e.g., Dream Essence).
Benefits of Feeding:
Affinity Boost: Increases the wisp’s bonding level (e.g., +5 bonding per feeding, once per day).
Energy Recharge: Restores a portion of the wisp’s energy (e.g., +2 energy points per feeding).
This mechanic not only deepens player engagement but also serves as a real-world method to manage in-game resources.
Monetization and Token Economy
Dream Tokens
Utility:
Dream Tokens serve as the in-game currency for recharging runes, replenishing wisp energy, and even extending daily dream submissions.

Acquisition:
These tokens can be purchased directly from the user’s Web3 wallet, integrated with established crypto exchange mechanisms.

Ecosystem Integration:
Tokens drive both monetization and gameplay extension without compromising the core free-to-play elements. They act as an accelerator for dedicated players while maintaining balance for casual gamers.

Implementation Details
Rune Durability and Energy Charges
Class Structure:
The DreamRune class includes properties for maximum charges and current charge count.
The use() method deducts a charge from both the rune and the wisp’s energy pool.
A recharge() method allows charges to be restored using Dream Tokens.
Wisp Binding and Behavior
Lucid Core Integration:
The LucidCore class manages bound wisps, enforces a maximum capacity of three, and tracks upgrade cooldowns.
The DreamWisp class monitors bonding and battle level, and includes methods for equipping runes and checking obedience.
Penalties for unruly behavior are built into combat resolution—self-damage, random rune depletion, and temporary hindrances.
Combat System
Hybrid Mechanics:
The combat system is built on an RPS framework (Attack, Defend, Evade, Channel) enhanced by elemental multipliers.
Elemental interactions (e.g., Fire vs. Nature) modify damage outcomes.
Unruly behavior is detected via bonding thresholds and player progression (knowledge and Core level) and can lead to adverse effects mid-combat.
NFT Smart Contracts
Smart Contract Features:
A Solidity-based ERC-721 contract defines the Dream Wisps with a built-in royalty (5% on trades).
On-chain metadata links each wisp to the owner’s Lucid Core.
The minting process is controlled by the contract owner and integrated into the game’s blockchain backend.
AR Integration
Frontend AR Implementation:
Using frameworks like AR.js and Three.js, the AR module renders 3D models of Dream Wisps in real time.
A simple “tap-to-feed” interface allows players to interact with their wisps via QR code markers, triggering in-game API calls to adjust affinity and energy.

Conclusion:
DreamWeaver fuses narrative immersion, strategic gameplay, and cutting-edge blockchain technology to create a truly unique gaming experience. By empowering players to harness their subconscious dreams, converting them into actionable in-game assets, and integrating these assets into a multi-layered progression system, the game provides both depth and accessibility. With features ranging from NFT-based ownership of the Lucid Core and Dream Wisps to dynamic combat mechanics and real-world AR interactions, every component has been designed to keep players engaged, reward strategic thinking, and create a vibrant, evolving ecosystem.

This whitepaper has detailed every aspect of the system—from dream submissions and rune energy charges to combat consequences and NFT trading—ensuring that nothing is left out. The holistic integration of these components lays the foundation for a game that is both thoroughly engaging and innovative.
